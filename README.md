# Woney

Woney is a management software written using web technologies as a front end (bootstrap), python as a back-end (flask) and python to handle the data.

## Getting Started

To get started, download a copy of Woney and launch `run.py` script :

```
python run.py
```

### Prerequisites

You need to have python 2.7 installed along with pandas and flask.
To do that quickly and with no arm, I recommend [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

### Installing

To be done ... so far I haven't made an installation script.

## Status of the software

This software is no longer under development. The main reason is that it is working with sufficient functionnalities so that I don't feel the need to put more effort into it. The second reason is that with the emergence of web technologies for desktop applications, I think it would need to be rewritten in angular + electron.

## TODO

- scheduled transfer
- edit transfer
- check that account name does not exists when creating the account
- macro to simplify error catching and printing in add transaction
- automatic backup of the database : everyday, every week and every month
- pause a reconcilation
- display all the scheduled transactions (even the ones that have been deleted)
